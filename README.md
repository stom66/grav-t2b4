## Customisation

To customise the theme and rebuild the css first do the following:

1) From the terminal `cd` to the theme dir: `cd /path/to/user/themes/t2b4`
2) Run: `npm install`
3) Run: `npm run watch` to trigger the gulp build

* Custom styles can be added and changed in `t2b4/src/scss/custom/_styles.scss`
* Google Fonts can be added and changed in `t2b4/src/scss/custom/_typography.scss`
* The most common Boostrap variables are in `t2b4/src/scss/custom/_variables.scss`

By default the Bootstrap/Bootswatch libraries are included from CDNs and are not included in `theme.css` If you wish to use a customised local Bootstrap style:

1) Disable the CSS CDN includes in the theme options
2) Uncomment the boostrap include statement in `t2b4/src/scss/theme.scss`
3) Run either `npm run watch` or `npm run build` to rebuild the CSS

You may wish to toggle the "Use minified CSS" option in the theme options during development to assist inspection.

### Favicons:

The theme has comprehensive support for favicons and will automatically resize images to a variety of sizes to ensure maxium compatibility with popular browsers and devices.

Upload your favicons to the folder `/user/images/icons` and select them via the Theme config page in the admin panel.

To enable support for ICO files in the theme configuration page add the following to `user/config/media.yaml`:

```
  ico:
    type: file
    thumb: media/thumb-png.png
    mime: image/x-icon
    image: null
```
